# GrowBloom's Temperature

## What is Temperature ?

Temperature is a program that runs on a Raspberry Pi and reads the temperature
from a sensor. Then, it exports the temperature to an instance of the Portal.

Even if only few sensors are currently supported the program is designed to be
able to add support to any temperature sensor.
